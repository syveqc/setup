# select a repository). Tildes are expanded. Multiple repositories are
# backed up to in sequence. Borg placeholders can be used. See the

# SSH options like identity file or port. If systemd service is used,
# then add local repository paths in the systemd service file to the
# ReadWritePaths list. Prior to borgmatic 1.7.10, repositories was a
# list of plain path strings.
